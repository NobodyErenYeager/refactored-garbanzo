<p>To learn properly you need to have a sense of where you are in your journey and what's important. But to do that, you need to see what it's like in the real world, you need to see behind the curtain...</p><p>...that's why I want to start you off by showing you what a <strong><em>REAL </em></strong>freelancing gig looks like - <strong>from start to finish</strong>.</p><p>The next lesson shows real conversations, real proposals, real freelancing work, and real clients. No other freelancing course offers you such an in-depth peak behind the curtains. By seeing the whole process you'll have a much better sense of <em>why</em> the skills and techniques you're taught in the rest of the course are important.</p><p>I hope you enjoy and learn a lot!</p>
